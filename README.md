##Project Description:

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been a staple in helping medical professionals diagnose and treat many forms of brain tumors. More often than not, this form of imaging will capture the presence of a tumor compared to a normal brain scan. However, not every form of brain tumor is obvious, and the pathology of the disease can have a major impact on its appearance during imaging. Knowing not only the location, but also its origin and morphology, is critical to determining a plan of treatment, something not always obvious on an MRI. Furthermore, a trained professional, such as a skilled neurosurgeon, is often necessary to diagnose brain tumors.
Recent advancements in deep image learning have proven effective in supporting contemporary diagnostic measures in the medical field. Therefore, the goal of this project is to create an artificial neural network (ANN) that is able to accurately identify the specific type of tumor present in a given image scan when considering varying sizes and shapes.
The dataset we plan to use for our project comes from a research paper from P. E.S. College of Engineering in Pune, India. This dataset showcases images of tumors labeled training and testing sets. The types of tumors include pituitary, glioma, and meningioma, and there are also training and testing images with no tumors. The images are not processed and include the outlines and skulls present within a normal MRI. 
The goal of our project is to build a model that will be able to recognize if there is a tumor present in an MRI image and discern what type of tumor is there. It should accomplish this by circling the tumor on the image and giving a text output to categorize it.
